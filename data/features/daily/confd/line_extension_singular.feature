Feature: Link a line and an extension

    Scenario: Link an extension with a SIP line without a user
        Given I have the following lines:
            | id     | context | protocol | device_slot |
            | 340940 | default | sip      | 1           |
        Given I have the following extensions:
            | exten | context |
            | 1502  | default |
        When I link extension "1502@default" with line id "340940"
        Then I get a response with status "201"
        Then I get a header with a location matching "/1.1/lines/\d+/extension"
        Then I get a response with a link to the "lines" resource using the id "line_id"
        Then I get a response with a link to the "extensions" resource using the id "extension_id"

    Scenario: Link an extension with a SIP line associated to a user

            | 980133 | default | sip      | 1           |
        Given line "980133" is linked with user "William" "Shatner"
        Given line "980133" is linked with extension "1503@default"
        Then I get a header with a location matching "/1.1/lines/\d+/extension"

        Given line "835437" is linked with user "Leonard" "McCoy"
        Given line "835437" is linked with extension "1507@default"
        When I send a request for the extension associated to line id "835437"
        Then I get a response with status "200"
        Then I get a response with a link to the "lines" resource using the id "line_id"
        Then I get a response with a link to the "extensions" resource using the id "extension_id"

    Scenario: Get the line associated to an extension

        When I dissociate the extension associated to line id "832642"
        Then I get a response with status "204"

    Scenario: Dissociate an extension when a device is associated
        Given I have the following devices:
          | ip             | mac               |
